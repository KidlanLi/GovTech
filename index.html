        <section id="current-situation">
            <h2>Current World Situation</h2>
            <p>The world is witnessing unprecedented environmental challenges. Global temperatures have risen by 1.1°C since pre-industrial levels, triggering extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and wildfires. In 2023 alone, over 20 million people were displaced due to climate-related disasters.</p>
            <p>Regions like the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa are on the frontlines of this crisis, where water scarcity and agricultural failures have intensified social tensions. The melting Arctic ice has further destabilized global ecosystems, while rising sea levels threaten coastal cities around the world.</p>
            <p>In South Asia, irregular monsoons and declining groundwater levels are pushing millions into poverty. Meanwhile, in the Amazon rainforest, deforestation rates have surged, reducing the planet's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide. The clock is ticking, and the decisions we make today will shape the future of humanity.</p>

        <!-- Part 2: Game Background -->
        <section id="game-background">
            <h2>Game Background</h2>
            <p>In the near future, the world has become a fragile battleground where the fight for survival revolves around access to three critical resources: <strong>water</strong>, <strong>food</strong>, and <strong>shelter</strong>. Climate change has upended traditional systems of governance, and alliances are now forged in the name of resource control rather than diplomacy.</p>
            <p>You are part of a community struggling to adapt. While global leaders debate over policies, disasters strike without warning, leaving ordinary citizens to face the brunt of these crises. As one of the key decision-makers, you will navigate through a world on the brink of collapse, balancing personal goals with collective survival.</p>
            <p>The game presents a scenario where every move counts. Your choices will determine whether your faction thrives, struggles, or succumbs to the pressures of an unforgiving environment. Will you be the hero who unites the world or the opportunist who secures personal gains at the expense of others?</p>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p><strong>Climate Conflict: The Game</strong> is a strategic, turn-based card game that challenges players to balance resource management, respond to dynamic events, and achieve their objectives. Each player assumes a unique role with distinct abilities, and the game's outcome depends on both individual and collective decisions.</p>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The goal is to either achieve personal victory by fulfilling your role's specific requirements or ensure the global climate tracker does not drop to zero, which would result in a shared loss.</p>
            <p><strong>Game Phases:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Event Phase:</strong> At the start of each round, a random event card is drawn. The event affects the game's climate tracker and players' resources. For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Drought:</strong> Reduces all players' water resources by 1 and decreases the climate tracker by 1.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flood:</strong> Destroys 1 infrastructure and reduces available water and food resources.</li>
                        <li><strong>Heatwave:</strong> Increases food consumption by 1 for all players.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Action Phase:</strong> Players take turns to act based on their roles:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Politician:</strong> Redistributes resources, mediates disputes, and enacts policies (e.g., water rationing).</li>
                        <li><strong>Scientist:</strong> Predicts the next event and proposes long-term solutions (e.g., building renewable infrastructure).</li>
                        <li><strong>Farmer:</strong> Converts water into food resources and negotiates resource trades.</li>
                        <li><strong>Industrialist:</strong> Builds infrastructure to mitigate future disasters and trades money for other resources.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Resolution Phase:</strong> The outcome of actions and the event is calculated. For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If players successfully manage resources to counteract the event, the climate tracker remains stable.</li>
                        <li>If resources are insufficient, penalties apply (e.g., food shortages reduce population stability).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Winning Conditions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Individual Victory:</strong> A player achieves their specific role objectives (e.g., building 3 infrastructures as the Industrialist).</li>
                <li><strong>Collective Victory:</strong> Prevent the global climate tracker from reaching zero by the end of the game.</li>
                <li><strong>Shared Loss:</strong> The climate tracker drops to zero, ending the game for all players.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Strategy Tips:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collaborate when necessary to prevent the climate tracker from dropping too low.</li>
                <li>Balance personal objectives with collective needs to avoid conflict with other players.</li>
                <li>Plan ahead using the Scientist's predictions and build infrastructure early to mitigate future disasters.</li>
            </ul>
